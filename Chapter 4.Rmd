Counts
Properties <Non-negative><Discrete integers>


Discrete distribution
<Bernoulli>
<Binomial>
<Poisson> When lamda is large it looks like normal, and when lamda is small, it is right-skewed.
Mean = lamda, variance = lamda
<Geometric>

What is the difference between Geometric and Poisson distribution.


For a constant variance model
Y_it ~ Po(lamda)

How do we find this lamda?
Maximum likelihood?
